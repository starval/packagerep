# Description
#'	Calculate the a weighted RFM score: recency, frequency, and monetary for every customers
#
# Arguments
#'@param	data - A data.table containing the transaction rececord details for every customer.
#'@param	weight_recency -  Weight of recency.
#'@param	weight_frequency -  Weight of frequency.
#'@param	weight_monetary -  Weight of monetary.

#' \code{data} contains the transactional data. The dataset must contain a
#'             column labeled "Customer" that allows unique customer identification
#'             and a column labeled "TransDate", indicating the purchase date.
#'             The column "PurchAmount" specifies the total spending per purchase.
#
# Return Value
#'@return	Returns a  data.data containing the recency, frequency and monetary
#'score as well as the weighted final score and the group membership.
